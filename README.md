## About me
I am a web developer in continuous training, currently I have knowledge of frontend and backend development. In programming languages at the moment, I only know JavaScript. Before beginning my education in web development, I was a graphic designer (specifically for companies) creating logos, layouts and others, using programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, or Premiere Pro. Therefore, it gave me a certain facility to handle UI/UX design inside the frontend.
